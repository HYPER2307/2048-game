# 2048 Game

## Project Overview
This version of the 2048 game is implemented using pure JavaScript with the addition of Webpack to bundle the JavaScript files. This setup showcases advanced JavaScript techniques and effective use of Webpack for asset compilation and development workflow automation. The objective is to combine tiles with the same numbers to achieve the tile 2048 in a 4x4 grid.
